Hello Dear TA!

This is project group: Jie Qi and Jiuzheng Chen!
We proudly present our miniRSA project.

User manual: (You may also use Eclipse to run)
1. "make"
2. "make runServer"
3. "make runClient"
4. Enter the client's keys in server (MUST BE DONE FIRST. So that server accepts connection)
5. Enter the server's keys in client
6. Start chatting
7. If you want to brute force crack the keys, just type in ".brute force"
8. To quit, type ".quit" in both terminals
9. "make clean"

Enjoy!
Sample runs (hilarious) are included :-)
Code is pretty straight forward. We tried very hard to make each other understand our codes so we wrote it in a simple and logical way.

THANKS FOR GRADING!
THANKS FOR ALL OF YOUR TIME SPENT ON OUR HOMEWORK THIS SEMESTER!
